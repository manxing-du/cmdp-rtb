## Constrained Markov Decision Process based Real-Time Bidding
This is the repository for the code used in the paper **Constrained Markov Decision Process based Real-Time Bidding**

## Experiment 1
Run under the **python** folder:
```bash
$ python3 CMDP.py
```

## Experiment 2
Run under the **python** folder:
```bash
$ python3 compare_bidding_functions.py
```

For the data preprocessing, we followed the [make-ipinyou-data](https://github.com/wnzhang/make-ipinyou-data "make-ipinyou-data")
For generating bid logs for lin, mcpc, and rlb, we followed the [rlb-dp](https://github.com/han-cai/rlb-dp/blob/master/README.md)
